## Translation

[ENYO-3875 When minified, forced language is not used (loaded to late...)](https://enyojs.atlassian.net/browse/ENYO-3875) 

Symptom: Ares under its minified form does not use the forced language 
value to select the right translations resources. It uses the navigator's 
language as value to determine the tranlation to apply. But in dev-mode, 
it works well.

Workaround: Non-english translation resources have been deactivated by 
commenting their content.

## Designer

Designer Drag&Drop feature works fine with Chrome Browser but is
broken (at various levels) with other browsers.

## npm libraries issues

Once Ares is  updated with `git` and `git submodule  update`, the node
library must be updated with `npm prune` and then `npm install`.

After several updates,  you may encounter errors with  the server like
start failure  or `project.json`  corruption. In  this case,  `npm ls`
will  return  errors   showing  problems  with  the   content  of  the
`node_modules` directory.

These errors  can be often be  fixed by running `npm  prune`.  If not,
you have to:

* remove the whole `node_modules` directory
* run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
* run `npm -d install`.

## PhoneGap Build

[ENYO-3491 Generated QRcode to download app contains user's authentication token](https://enyojs.atlassian.net/browse/ENYO-3491)

Symptom: Ares Build status show a QRcode containing an URL that can be
used to download an application directly on a mobile device.
Currently, this URL contains the token of the developer's
account. This raises a security issue as the user can then get access
to the developer's account on phonegap until the token is revoked.

Workaround: Use the QRcode generated by Ares only for your tests. Send
the QRcode generated by Phonegap to your users.


## Function name collision between ace and state-machine


When ``ace`` is loaded before ``state-machine``, a function name
collision occurs and console will show the following message:

    > dropping module because define wasn't a string. ace.js:1
    > n ace.js:1
    > (anonymous function) state-machine-2.2.0.min.js:1
    > (anonymous function)

``ace`` defines a global ``define`` function (either directly or by loading requirejs) and
``state-machine``
[tests for the existence of this function before using it](https://github.com/jakesgordon/javascript-state-machine/blob/master/state-machine.js#L194) which leads to unexpected result.

The workaround is to load ``state-machine`` before ``ace`` so that ``define`` function is not called by ``state-machine`` in
[Ares index.html](ares/index.html)
